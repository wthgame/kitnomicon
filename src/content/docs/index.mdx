If you're happy just building towers and keeping things primitive with
Welcome To Hell, you can probably skip this. You don't need the Kitnomicon to
build outstanding towers. But if you're the kind of person who wants to know how
everything works, this book contains lots of useful information.

Unlike [The Buildnomicon], we're going to assume background familiarity with
Roblox Studio and the Kit. Consider the book as what's in the Kit, not an
introduction to it. If you're planning on creating your own kit objects or
exploring the standard library, you'll need to be comfortable with Luau and
working with its type system. If those topics feel new, check out these
resources first:

<LinkCard

  description="Every builder's comprehensive journey into Welcome To Hell."
/>

<LinkCard
  title="Luau"
  href="https://luau.org/"
  description="Documentation for the Luau language"
/>

This book only covers the stable Kit. Nightly Kit releases are planned once
Act 3 or the Beta is released.

Finally, this isn't the official specification for the Kit. One day, it will be
made. For now, the Kitnomicon is the closest thing Welcome To Hell has to a
specification.

## Using The Kitnomicon

### Typings

On many reference pages, you'll see type annotations such as:

```luau
function KitStd.connectActivation(
  outerTrove: trove.Trove,
  connectTo: T & Instance,
  onActivated: (outerTrove: trove.Trove, instance: T, activationTrove: trove.Trove) -> (),
  defaultMode: ActivationMode?
): ()
```

While these type annotations are designed to be Luau-like, it is ultimately
psuedocode included as a developer aid. For fully accurate and syntactically
valid type information, please refer to the source code directly.
