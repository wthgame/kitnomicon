Global and immutable configuration for the Kit.

## Properties

### debug

```luau

KitStdConfig.debug: boolean

```

Controls whether debug mode is enabled for the Kit.
In debug, additional logging and checks may be performed, which can
help tower building. Enabling debug mode will impact performance.
When debug is enabled, the maximum logger level is set to verbose.
Otherwise, it is set to warnings and errors.
Defaults to the "Debug" attribute on the Workspace, or otherwise whether the
game is running in Roblox Studio.
Reexposed as `_G.WTH_DEBUG`.

### typecheck

```luau

KitStdConfig.typecheck: boolean

```

Determines if the standard library should perform runtime type validation,
helping to catch type errors while authoring kit scripts and kit objects.
However, this adds a performance overhead.
Defaults to the "Typecheck" attribute on the Workspace, or otherwise whether
the game is running in Roblox Studio.
Reexposed as `_G.WTH_TYPECHECK`.
