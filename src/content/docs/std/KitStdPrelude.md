Welcome To Hell comes with a variety of things in its utility
library. However, if you had to manually import every single thing
that you used, it would be very verbose. But importing a lot of
things that a script never uses isnâ€™t good either. A balance needs
to be struck.
The prelude is the list of things that most KitScripts will use, and
is kept as small as possible.
```luau
local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")
local std = require(ReplicatedStorage:WaitForChild("KitStd"))
local prelude = std.prelude
```
When Luau table destructuring is implemented, the prelude can be
imported as such:
```luau
local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")
local std = require(ReplicatedStorage:WaitForChild("KitStd"))
-- waiting on https://github.com/luau-lang/rfcs/pull/95
local { .attribute, .isBasePart, .getMaybeRootPart } = std.prelude
```
