Limits the amount of activations for a given kit object.

```luau
LimitActivations = {
	-- Attributes
	MaxActivations: std.Attribute<number>,
	ResetWhenUnactivatable: std.Attribute<boolean>,
}
```



## Attributes



### MaxActivations

```luau
LimitActivations.MaxActivations: std.Attribute<number>

```

The amount of activations before the limited kit object should not be
activatable.





### ResetWhenUnactivatable

```luau
LimitActivations.ResetWhenUnactivatable: std.Attribute<boolean>

```

If a kit object should reset it's "activations count" when it's
`Activatable` attribute is disabled.
