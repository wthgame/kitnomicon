## API



### Types



#### Damage

```luau
export type Damage = number | "Normal" | "Double" | "Quadruple" | "Lethal"

```

Defines the amounts of Damage to be dealt. Positive number can be used to
define variable damage values. Otherwise, the following is used:
| Name          | Amount   |
| ------------- | -------- |
| `"Normal"`    | `10`     |
| `"Double"`    | `20`     |
| `"Quadruple"` | `40`     |
| `"Lethal"`    | Infinite |





#### DamageMeasurement

```luau
export type DamageMeasurement = "Raw" | "RelativeToMaxHealth"

```

The measurement of damage to be dealt. `Raw` is treated as raw health, while
`RelativeToMaxHealth` is treated as a percentage of the player's maximum
health.
