Visually hides the tagged instance. Useful when working with bigger objects
that benefit from being visible while editing, but should be hidden while
playing a tower.

```luau
Hidden = {
	-- Attributes
	HideDescendants: std.Attribute<boolean>,
}
```



## Attributes



### HideDescendants

```luau
Hidden.HideDescendants: std.Attribute<boolean>

```

Whether descendants should be hidden as well. Turning on `HideDescendants`
on a Model of Folder of objects is more managable than manually tagging
each child.
