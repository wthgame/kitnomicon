Conveyors speeds contacting objects facing it's direction.

```luau
Conveyor = {
	-- Attributes
	Speed: std.Attribute<number>,
	SynchronizeConveyorBeams: std.Attribute<boolean>,
}
```



## Attributes



### Speed

```luau
Conveyor.Speed: std.Attribute<number>

```

The speed in studs per second that objects move along the conveyor.





### SynchronizeConveyorBeams

```luau
Conveyor.SynchronizeConveyorBeams: std.Attribute<boolean>

```

If true, the conveyor will update all Beam objects named "ConveyorBeam" to
move at the same pace as the `Speed` attribute.
