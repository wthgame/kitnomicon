WOW

## Attributes

### Synchronized

```luau

MovingTexture.Synchronized: boolean

```

If enabled, MovingTexture will be offsetted based on the kit's loaded
lifetime, therefore never desyncing. If not, MovingTexture will increment
it's offset every frame.
Synchronized should be used when MovingTextures are being chained to create
one continous patterns, so it doesn't desync.
Synchronized should not be used when the speed of MovingTextures
will change, or else it looks jittery. Disabling Synchronized will allow the
MovingTexture to adopt the new texture speed.
