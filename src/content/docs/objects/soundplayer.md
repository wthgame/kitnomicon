SoundPlayers, when actviated, emit a sound effect inferred from it's
attributes or children.
The SoundPlayer will play the first thing found in order:
1. A `PlayFromAssets` key
2. A `Sound` attribute
3. A `Sound` instance named "Sound"

```luau
SoundPlayer = {
	-- Attributes
	PlayFromAssets: keyof<typeof(std.audio.AUDIO_ASSETS)>?,
	Sound: string?,
	Spatial: boolean,
	Speed: number?,
	Volume: number?,
	Activatable: boolean,
	ActivationBehavior: ActivationBehavior,
}
```



## Attributes



### PlayFromAssets

```luau
SoundPlayer.PlayFromAssets: keyof<typeof(std.audio.AUDIO_ASSETS)>?

```

Plays a sound directly from Welcome To Hell's audio assets.
If specified, this attribute overrides any Sound attribute or Sound instance
parented under the SoundPlayer.





### Sound

```luau
SoundPlayer.Sound: string?

```

An asset ID that should be used if a `PlayFromAssets` attribute or a
`Sound` instance isn't present.





### Spatial

```luau
SoundPlayer.Spatial: boolean

```

Toggles if the sound should be parented to the part, so played "spatially",
or parented to nil, so played "globally".





### Speed

```luau
SoundPlayer.Speed: number?

```

Divides the sound's duration, ie. value of 1 means normal speed, value
of 2 means double speed, value of 0.5 means half speed. If specified, this
overrides the `PlaybackSpeed` property in any Sound instance.





### Volume

```luau
SoundPlayer.Volume: number?

```

How loud should the sound be. If specified, this overrides the `Volume`
property in any Sound instance.





### Activatable

```luau
SoundPlayer.Activatable: boolean

```

Whether this object can be activated. See the [Activation](../../guides/activation) page.





### ActivationBehavior

```luau
SoundPlayer.ActivationBehavior: ActivationBehavior

```

How should this object be activated. See the [Activation](../../guides/activation) page.
