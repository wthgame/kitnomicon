SoundPlayers, when actviated, emit a sound effect inferred from it's
attributes or children.

The SoundPlayer will play the first thing found in order:

1. A `PlayFromAssets` key
2. A `Sound` attribute
3. A `Sound` instance named "Sound"

## Attributes

### PlayFromAssets

```luau

SoundPlayer.PlayFromAssets: keyof<AUDIO_ASSETS>?

```

TBA
This overrides the Sound attribute or a Sound instance.

### Sound

```luau

SoundPlayer.Sound: string?

```

An asset ID that should be used if a `PlayFromAssets` attribute or a
`Sound` instance isn't present.

### Spatial

```luau

SoundPlayer.Spatial: boolean

```

Toggles if the sound should be parented to the part, so played "spatially",
or parented to nil, so played "globally".

### Speed

```luau

SoundPlayer.Speed: number?

```

Divides the sound's duration, ie. value of 1 means normal speed, value
of 2 means double speed, value of 0.5 means half speed. If specified, this
overrides the `PlaybackSpeed` property in any Sound instance.

### Volume

```luau

SoundPlayer.Volume: number?

```

How loud should the sound be. If specified, this overrides the `Volume`
property in any Sound instance.
